          <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
          <p style="line-height: 200%">Hi! My name is Buenrico O. Tan Jr. I am 17 Years Old and I’m a student at Asian College - Dumaguete.
            <br>
            <br>
            I was born and raised in Dumaguete City and have always been interested in technology.
            <br>
            I have a lot of experience in web designing and <br>
            I have also always wanted to start being a freelancer.
            <br>
            <br>
            When I was younger, I would sit at the computer all day—and it wasn’t just for fun! It was because I wanted to express myself and to discover how a computer worked.
            
            I’ve always loved watching about technology, but my favorite thing to watch is tutorials or tech reviews on YouTube. I think they’re so interesting! They can be very informative.
